## Hi there 👋

Welcome to the AmoebaLabsAI GitHub page. This is a project started by Joseph and Thierry Damiba to make it easier for AI developers to find the right text embedding model for their chat applications, especially in the context of retrieval augmented generation.

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
